		<h2> About ZEUS </h2>
		<p  class="text-justify">The 8th ZEUS Workshop (ZEUS 2016) will take place at <a href="http://www.tuwien.ac.at/tuwien_home/">TU Wien</a> on January 27 and 28, 2016.</p>

		<p  class="text-justify">You are invited to join a workshop that focuses on the discussion of fresh ideas, the presentation of work in progress, and the establishment of a scientific network between young researchers in the region.</p>

		<center><em>Participation is free of charge!</em></center>

		<h4>Discuss fresh ideas</h4>
		<p class="text-justify"> We offer a forum to discuss ideas at a level that is more work-in-progress than in a traditional conference. We thereby want to attract especially PhD students in the early phases of their work. Participants can get feedback from outside their group before submitting a paper to a reviewed conference. This makes ZEUS an original opportunity to discuss ideas.</p>
		
		<h4>Practice scientific work</h4>

		<p class="text-justify">We see the ZEUS workshop as an opportunity to practice the whole range of scientific work. We do not take the sole focus on the submitted papers, but also on the presentations and the discussions on the workshop. To this end, we hand out a Best Presentation Award since 2010 at the end of the workshop to appreciate high quality presentations.</p>

		<h4>Establish contacts between young researchers in the region</h4>

		<p class="text-justify">We aim at bringing together young researchers who work in the same geographic region and the same scientific field. This way, we provide an opportunity for people to establish a scientific network that can be intensely used, including mutual visits at affordable costs. The workshop will serve as a platform to present current research ideas and research directions. Past editions of the ZEUS workshop have indeed led to new research collaborations which resulted in scientific publications at top conferences in the field.</p>
