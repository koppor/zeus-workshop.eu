		<h2> Call for Papers </h3>
		<p class="text-justify">ZEUS focuses on the discussion of fresh ideas, the presentation of work in progress, and the establishment of a scientific network between young researchers in the region. You can also download the <a href="todo.html">Call for Papers</a>.</p>

		<h3>Topics</h3>
		<p class="text-justify">The topics of the ZEUS workshop are centered around service technology, which includes a rich set of facets. The purpose of analysis, synthesis or simulation of service technologies are as welcome as practical evaluations, use case-driven feasibility studies, or technology adoption models. ZEUS also calls for contributions in the field of Cloud computing and RESTful services.</p>

		<p>Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Aspects around the service lifecycle (analysis, specification, modeling, testing, deployment, execution, monitoring)</li>
			<li>Patterns, languages, and reference models</li>
			<li>Multi-view and multi-perspective engineering (SOA, choreographies, collaborations, conversations, artifact-centric systems)</li>
			<li>Formal methods, models, simulation and verification</li>
			<li>RESTful systems (design aspects, hypermedia, linked data, mashups, other protocols, ...)</li>
			<li>Workflows and business processes</li>
			<li>Complex event processing (correlation, aggregation, transformation, monitoring, extraction)</li>
			<li>Security, compliance, and nonfunctional properties</li>
			<li>Cloud-enabled applications, migration to/from the Cloud, big data</li>
			<li>Applications, frameworks, tool demonstration, and case studies</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Submission</h3>
		<p class="text-justify">We are looking forward to three types of contributions for ZEUS 2016. All papers must be submitted following the instructions at the <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=zeus2016">ZEUS 2016 submission site</a>, handled by EasyChair.</p>

		<p class="text-justify">Results can be presented in talks or tool demonstrations. Submissions will be reviewed by at least three reviewers each in order to assure general fitness regarding content, readability and scope and to give first feedback to the authors. Depending on innovation, technical soundness and presentation clarity, papers may be rejected or accepted as position, workshop or tool demonstration paper.</p>

		<h4>Workshop papers</h4>
		<p class="text-justify">Workshop papers are "regular" contributions that describe original solutions in field of ZEUS. These papers must not exceed 6 pages (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/latextemplates/LNCS">LNCS style</a>). Workshop papers are reviewed according to the Call for Papers. Accepted papers shall be included in the proceedings and presented at the workshop.</p>
		
		<h4>Positions papers</h4>
		<p>Position papers should draft a new idea and put it up for discussion at the workshop. Position papers should only be an extended abstract and must not exceed 3 pages (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/latextemplates/LNCS">LNCS style</a>). Position papers are briefly reviewed according to the Call for Papers. The main idea and the relation to existing work should be contained. Accepted papers shall be included in the proceedings.</p>

		<p class="text-justify">Position papers have been introduced based on the experiences gained from the last editions of the workshop. They allow authors to get early feedback during the workshop, but should not disallow extending the paper to a full paper submitted to a first class conference â€“ even if the position paper is referenced and the delta is explained properly.</p>
		
		<h4>Tool demonstrations</h4>
		<p class="text-justify">ZEUS also offers a forum to demonstrate implementations of techniques and algorithms in the area of the aforementioned topics to get early feedback and provide interesting insights for the audience. Tool demonstrators are asked to submit a demo script of no more than 3 pages (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/latextemplates/LNCS">LNCS style</a>) which states how the tool is linked to the Call for Papers and what to expect during the demonstration.</p>

<p>The LNCS style can be downloaded at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/latextemplates/LNCS">Springer</a>.</>
