ZEUS 2012: CALL FOR PAPERS                 [Apologies for cross-postings]

=============================================================================
4th Central-European Workshop on Services and their Composition (ZEUS)

February 23-24, 2012 * Bamberg, Germany * http://zeus2012.pi.uni-bamberg.de/
=============================================================================

The 4th Central-European Workshop on Services and their Composition (ZEUS) will
take place at Otto-Friedrich-University of Bamberg, Germany, on February 23rd and 24th, 2012.
ZEUS is a free, but high-quality opportunity to discuss research work.
================================
Participation is free of charge!
================================

Objectives
==========

1. Discuss fresh ideas

ZEUS is a classical scientific workshop. We are seeking creative ideas and
ongoing scientific work with some preliminary results. ZEUS offers you an
open-minded community of services researchers who are willing to discuss
your ideas and help you improve your contents for highly ranked conferences.
Your submission will be peer-reviewed by at least three independent reviewers
and may be rejected, accepted as position statement or as full workshop paper.
Innovation and creativity are the most important factors for ZEUS. Of course,
the rules of technical correctness and scientific method must be adhered to as well.

2. Establish young researchers’ network

We aim at bringing together young researchers who work in the same geographic
and the same scientific region. We would like to provide an opportunity for
young researchers to establish a scientific network that can be intensely used,
including mutual visits at affordable costs. The workshop will serve as platform
to present current research ideas and research directions. Although grounded in
the German-speaking services community, ZEUS is open to the European services
community as a whole. Submissions and talks are expected to be provided in English.


Topics
======

The topics of the ZEUS workshop are centered around choreography and orchestration
technology which includes a rich set of facets. Formal aspects of choreography or
orchestration languages for the purpose of analysis, synthesis or simulation of
service compositions are as welcome as practical evaluations, use case-driven
feasibility studies or technology adoption models. In particular, the use of
choreography and orchestration models by different types of stakeholders, say
software engineers and domain experts, and the application of choreography and
orchestration in cloud-based computing models are of major interest.

Topics include, but are not limited to:

Integration of choreography and orchestration models
Conformance notions
Analysis, simulation and verification
Modelling and specification
Execution and monitoring
Testing, deployment and practical issues
Adoption models for choreography and orchestration technology
Value and maturity assessment
Multi-view and multi-perspective engineering
Advanced communication qualities in choreography and orchestration scenarios
Patterns
Choreographies and orchestrations in Cloud environments
Interoperability of language formats as well as models


Submission
==========

Results can be presented in talks or tool demonstrations. Submissions will be reviewed
by at least three reviewers each in order to assure general fitness regarding content,
readability and scope and to give first feedback to the authors. Depending on innovation,
technical soundness and presentation clarity, papers may be rejected or accepted as
position statement or full paper.

Papers and tool demonstrations can be submitted until January 20, 2012 via Easychair
(https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=zeus2012).
Submitted papers shall not exceed 6 pages in Springer LNCS style.
