      <p>ZEUS focuses on the discussion of fresh ideas, the presentation of work in progress, and the establishment of a scientific network between young researchers in the region.</p>

        <p>Participation is free of charge!</p>

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
          <h3>Establish contacts between young researchers in the region</h3>

        <p>We aim at bringing together young researchers who work in the same geographic
        and the same scientific region. This way, we would like to provide an 
        opportunity for people to establish a scientific network that can be 
        intensely used, including  mutual visits at affordable costs. The workshop 
        will serve as a platform  to present current research ideas and research directions.</p>

        <h3>Discuss fresh ideas</h3>

        <p>We offer a forum to discuss ideas at a level that is more work-in-progress than 
        in a traditional conference. We thereby want to attract especially PhD students in the early phases of their work. Participants can get  feedback from outside their 
        group before a submission to a reviewed conference. This makes ZEUS an original
        opportunity to discuss ideas.</p>

        <h3>Practice scientific work</h3>

        <p>We see the ZEUS workshop as an opportunity to practice the whole  range of scientific
        work. We do not take the sole focus on the submitted  papers, but also in the 
        presentations and the discussions on the  workshop. To this end, we hand out a 
        <em>Best Presentation Award</em> since 2010 at the end of the workshop to appreciate 
        high quality presentations.</p>

        <h2>Topics</h2>

        <p>The topics of the ZEUS workshop are centered around service technology, which includes 
        a rich set of facets. The purpose of analysis, synthesis or simulation of
        service compositions are as welcome as practical evaluations, use case-driven
        feasibility studies, or technology adoption models. ZEUS also calls for contributions in
        the field of Cloud computing and RESTful services.</p>

        <p>Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Aspects around the service lifecycle (analysis, specification, modeling, testing, deployment, execution, monitoring)
        <li>Patterns and reference models
        <li>Multi-view and multi-perspective engineering (choreographies, artifact-centric systems)
        <li>Analysis, simulation, and verification
        <li>Formal methods and models
        <li>RESTful systems (design aspects, hypermedia, linked data, mashups, other protocols, ...)
        <li>Workflows and business processes
        <li>Security, compliance, nonfunctional properties
        <li>Value and maturity assessment
          <li>Cloud-enabled applications, migration to/from the Cloud
        <li>Applications, frameworks, tool kits, and case studies
      </ul>

        <h2>Submission</h2>

        We are looking forward to three types of contributions for ZEUS 2013:

        <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <h3>Workshop papers</h3>
        <p>Workshop papers are "regular" contributions that describe original solutions in field of ZEUS. These papers must not exceed 6 pages (LNCS style). Workshop papers are reviewed according to the call for papers. Accepted papers shall be included in the proceedings and presented at the workshop.
        <h3>Positions papers</h3>
        <p>Position papers should draft a new idea and put it up for discussion at the workshop. Position papers should only be an extended abstract and must not exceed 3 pages (LNCS style). Position papers are briefly reviewed according to the call for papers. The main idea and the relation to existing work should be contained. Accepted papers shall be included in the proceedings. Position papers have been introduced based on the experiences gained from the last editions. They allow authors to get early feedback during the workshop, but should not disallow to extend the paper to a full paper submitted to a first class conference - even if the position paper is referenced and the delta is explained properly.
        <h3>Tools demonstrations</h3>
        <p>ZEUS also offers a forum to demonstrate implementations of techniques and algorithms in the area of ZEUS to get early feedback and provide interesting insights for the audience. Tool demonstrators are asked to submit a demo script of no more than 3 pages (LNCS style) which states how the tool is linked to the call for papers and what to expect during the demonstration.</p>
      </div>

        <p>Results can be presented in talks or tool demonstrations. Submissions will be reviewed
        by at least three reviewers each in order to assure general fitness regarding content,
        readability and scope and to give first feedback to the authors. Depending on innovation,
        technical soundness and presentation clarity, papers may be rejected or accepted as
        position or workshop paper.

        <p>Papers and tool demonstrations can be submitted until January 20, 2013 via <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=zeus2013">Easychair</a>.
        The LNCS style can be downloaded at <a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0">Springer</a>.
