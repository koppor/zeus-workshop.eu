ZEUS 2013: CALL FOR PAPERS                 [Apologies for cross-postings]

=============================================================================
5th Central-European Workshop on Services and their Composition (ZEUS)

February 21-22, 2013 * Rostock, Germany * http://zeus-workshop.eu/2013
=============================================================================

The 5th Central-European Workshop on Services and their Composition (ZEUS) will
take place at University of Rostock, Germany, on February 21st and 22nd, 2013.
ZEUS focuses on the discussion of fresh ideas, the presentation of work in
progress, and the establishment of a scientific network between young
researchers in the region.


================================
Participation is free of charge!
================================

Objectives
==========

1. Establish contacts between young researchers in the region

We aim at bringing together young researchers who work in the same geographic
and the same scientific region. This way, we would like to provide an
opportunity for people to establish a scientific network that can be intensely
used, including mutual visits at affordable costs. The workshop will serve as
a platform to present current research ideas and research directions.

2. Discuss fresh ideas

We offer a forum to discuss ideas at a level that is more work-in-progress
than in a traditional conference. We thereby want to attract especially PhD
students in the early phases of their work. Participants can get feedback
from outside their group before a submission to a reviewed conference. This
makes ZEUS an original opportunity to discuss ideas.

3. Practice scientific work

We see the ZEUS workshop as an opportunity to practice the whole range of
scientific work. We do not take the sole focus on the submitted papers, but
also in the presentations and the discussions on the workshop. To this end,
we hand out a Best Presentation Award since 2010 at the end of the workshop
to appreciate high quality presentations.


Topics
======

The topics of the ZEUS workshop are centered around service technology, which
includes a rich set of facets. The purpose of analysis, synthesis or
simulation of service compositions are as welcome as practical evaluations,
use case-driven feasibility studies, or technology adoption models. ZEUS also
calls for contributions in the field of Cloud computing and RESTful services.

Topics include, but are not limited to:

- Aspects around the service lifecycle (analysis, specification, modeling,
  testing, deployment, execution, monitoring)
- Patterns and reference models
- Multi-view and multi-perspective engineering (choreographies,
  artifact-centric systems)
- Analysis, simulation, and verification
- Formal methods and models
- RESTful systems (design aspects, hypermedia, linked data, mashups, other
  protocols, ...)
- Workflows and business processes
- Security, compliance, nonfunctional properties
- Value and maturity assessment
- Cloud-enabled applications, migration to/from the Cloud
- Applications, frameworks, tool kits, and case studies


Submission
==========

We are looking forward to three types of contributions for ZEUS 2013:

Workshop papers: Workshop papers are "regular" contributions that describe
original solutions in field of ZEUS. These papers must not exceed 6 pages
(LNCS style). Workshop papers are reviewed according to the call for papers.
Accepted papers shall be included in the proceedings and presented at the
workshop.

Positions papers: Position papers should draft a new idea and put it up for
discussion at the workshop. Position papers should only be an extended
abstract and must not exceed 3 pages (LNCS style). Position papers are briefly
reviewed according to the call for papers. The main idea and the relation to
existing work should be contained. Accepted papers shall be included in the
proceedings. Position papers have been introduced based on the experiences
gained from the last editions. They allow authors to get early feedback during
the workshop, but should not disallow to extend the paper to a full paper
submitted to a first class conference - even if the position paper is
referenced and the delta is explained properly.

Tools demonstrations: ZEUS also offers a forum to demonstrate implementations
of techniques and algorithms in the area of ZEUS to get early feedback and
provide interesting insights for the audience. Tool demonstrators are asked
to submit a demo script of no more than 3 pages (LNCS style) which states
how the tool is linked to the call for papers and what to expect during the
demonstration.

Results can be presented in talks or tool demonstrations. Submissions will be
reviewed by at least three reviewers each in order to assure general fitness
regarding content, readability and scope and to give first feedback to the
authors. Depending on innovation, technical soundness and presentation
clarity, papers may be rejected or accepted as position or workshop paper.

Papers and tool demonstrations can be submitted until January 20, 2013 via
Easychair (https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=zeus2013). The LNCS
style can be downloaded at Springer
(http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0).
